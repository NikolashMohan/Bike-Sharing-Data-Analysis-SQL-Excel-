Project: Bike-Sharing Data Analysis (SQL & Excel)

SQL Analysis: Designed database schema and created a bike_trips table. Wrote queries using GROUP BY, MIN, MAX, COUNT, AVG, and DISTINCT to analyze trip patterns, identify shortest/longest trips, and count unique bikes.

Excel Dashboard: Built a professional dashboard in Excel 2019 with KPI cards (Shortest Trip, Longest Trip, Unique Bikes) and charts (member type distribution, trip duration analysis, hourly trends, top starting stations).

Combined SQL insights with Excel visualizations to present key business metrics and improve decision-making.
